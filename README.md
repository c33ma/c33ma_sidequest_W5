## Project Title
Side Quest Week 4: Puzzle Maze

---
## Description
This project is a tile-based maze game where the player navigates through multiple levels to collect all points and advance. The player moves through a grid filled with walls, one-way paths, gates, switches, and fail tiles that reset the level. The design was inspired by classic maze games like Pac-Man, but reimagined as a puzzle experience that focuses on spatial logic and decision-making rather than enemies or chasing mechanics.
