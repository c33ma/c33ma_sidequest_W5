## Project Title
Side Quest Week 5: Space Drift

---
## Description
This project is a reflective exploration experience set in a large open space environment. The player controls a small spaceship drifting through a world much larger than the screen, with a smooth camera that follows gently behind. The environment includes parallax stars, distant planets, and subtle nebula haze to create depth and atmosphere.

The focus of the project is on pacing and motion. Movement feels calm and intentional, while stillness creates a quiet floating sensation. Small discoverable objects such as an astronaut, an alien, and space artifacts are scattered throughout the world. When the player gets close to them, a short message appears, encouraging curiosity and exploration rather than challenge or urgency.
